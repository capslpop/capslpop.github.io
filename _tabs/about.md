# Hello!

I'm an undergraduate physics student at the University of Illinois, Grainger College of Engineering, with a strong foundation in computer graphics and low-level rendering. Over the past six years, I've built multiple rendering engines using technologies like OpenGL, Vulkan, WebGL, DirectX 11, GLSL, HLSL, and Unity’s Shader Pipeline.

My passion lies in real-time physics simulation—particularly fluid, rigid body, and soft body dynamics. I'm currently developing a toy physics simulation engine designed to inspire curiosity in young adults and kids. My goal is to make cutting-edge physics technology more approachable and avalible. While the underlying tech may be complex, the concepts we can learn from it are often beautifully simple.

To follow my progress more closely here is my youtube page where I post more regularly:
